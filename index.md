How do people celebrate **Independence Day** here?

In Mexico, on Independence Day, we prepare Mexican food such as Mole, Chiles en Nogada, but my favorite is Pozole. We wear typical clothes from the Mexican Revolution, paint the Mexican flag on our faces, and watch the fireworks.

Both sentences convey the same meaning.

There is no significant difference in meaning between the two sentences in this context.

# Maybe and perhaps

**“Maybe”** and **“perhaps”** are both adverbs used to express uncertainty or possibility. They are often used interchangeably, but there are some subtle differences in usage and formality.

1. Maybe:

“Maybe” is more commonly used in informal contexts. It’s straightforward and casual.
Example: “I’ll maybe go to the movies later.”
“Maybe” is often used at the beginning or middle of a sentence.

2. Perhaps:

“Perhaps” is slightly more formal and can be used in both formal and informal contexts, but it’s generally considered a bit more polite.
Example: “Perhaps we should consider another approach.”
“Perhaps” can be used in the middle or at the beginning of a sentence, but it’s more common at the beginning in formal writing.
Both words are used to express uncertainty or possibility, but “perhaps” has a slightly more refined and polite tone, making it a good choice in more professional or academic settings. “Maybe” is more commonly used in everyday conversations.

Usage Examples:

Maybe: "I’m not sure if I’ll be able to make it to the party. Maybe I’ll come a bit later."
Perhaps: “Perhaps it would be best to reschedule the meeting to accommodate everyone’s availability.”

In summary, the choice between “maybe” and “perhaps” often depends on the context and the level of formality you wish to convey. Both words can be used to indicate uncertainty or possibility, but “perhaps” is generally considered slightly more formal and polite.

**Passengers** usually **board** a flight thirty minutes before the plane leaves.

**board** means **get on**

It reminds me of a beautiful science fiction and romantic movie called "Passengers"
starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. The movie implies that humans always need company.

You say you want education in English. Well, you know, we all want to change the world, but when you scream at people, I don't think you deserve to teach. Go4More

Instead, Platzi and Duolingo are truly revolutionizing education.

Did you **get** that?

Once I read that you can use get as a synonym of undestand. Even is more common to use that **understand**. 

The word "get" can be used as a synonym for "understand" in informal speech. For example, you might say "I get what you're saying" or "I don't get it".

The word "get" is more common than "understand" in informal speech because it is shorter and easier to say. It is also more versatile, as it can be used in a wider variety of contexts.

However, the word "understand" is still the more formal and accurate way to say that you comprehend something. So, if you are writing or speaking in a formal setting, it is best to use the word "understand".

Here are some examples of how the word "get" can be used as a synonym for "understand":

- "I finally get what you're saying."
- "I don't get this math problem."
- "Can you help me get this?" (meaning "understand this")
- "I get it now." (meaning "I understand now")

**“Sore”** can be used as a synonym for **“hurt”** in certain contexts, especially when referring to physical discomfort or pain in a specific part of the body.

For example:

- My muscles are sore after the intense workout.
- Her throat is sore because she has a cold.
- I can’t walk properly; my feet are really sore.

However, it’s important to note that **“sore”** is often used to describe a specific type of discomfort, such as the result of muscle strain, injury, or illness, whereas **“hurt”** can have a broader range of meanings and can refer to emotional pain as well.
